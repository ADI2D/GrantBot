# Phase 2 - Production Readiness âœ… COMPLETE

## Overview

Phase 2 of the grant ingestion pipeline has been successfully implemented! The system now includes:

- **Admin Dashboard UI** for monitoring connector health
- **Manual Sync Controls** to trigger syncs on-demand
- **Scheduled Daily Syncs** via Vercel Cron
- **Real-time Health Monitoring** with auto-refresh
- **Sync History & Audit Logs** for debugging

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Admin API Endpoints

**[src/app/api/admin/sync-grants/route.ts](../src/app/api/admin/sync-grants/route.ts)**
- `POST /api/admin/sync-grants`
- Trigger manual syncs from UI
- Supports incremental and full refresh modes
- Runs sync in background (non-blocking)

**[src/app/api/admin/connector-health/route.ts](../src/app/api/admin/connector-health/route.ts)**
- `GET /api/admin/connector-health`
- Returns connector status with health metrics
- Calculates health based on sync freshness (>48hrs = warning)
- Provides summary counts (total, healthy, warning, error)

**[src/app/api/admin/sync-logs/route.ts](../src/app/api/admin/sync-logs/route.ts)**
- `GET /api/admin/sync-logs`
- View sync history and audit trail
- Supports filtering by source
- Returns up to 50 most recent logs

### 2. Admin Dashboard UI

**[src/app/(dashboard)/admin/connectors/page.tsx](../src/app/(dashboard)/admin/connectors/page.tsx)**

Features:
- **Summary Cards** - Total connectors, healthy, warnings, errors
- **Connector List** - Real-time status for each data source
- **Manual Sync Buttons** - Trigger incremental or full refresh
- **Recent Activity Log** - View last 10 sync operations
- **Auto-refresh** - Updates every 30 seconds via React Query
- **Loading States** - Visual feedback during sync operations

Navigation:
- Added to sidebar: [src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx:27](../src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx#L27)
- Menu item: "Connectors" with Settings icon
- Path: `/admin/connectors`

### 3. Scheduled Daily Syncs

**[vercel.json](../vercel.json)**
- Cron configuration for Vercel deployment
- Schedule: `0 2 * * *` (Daily at 2:00 AM UTC)
- Triggers: `/api/cron/sync-grants`

**[src/app/api/cron/sync-grants/route.ts](../src/app/api/cron/sync-grants/route.ts)**
- Automated daily grant sync endpoint
- Protected by `CRON_SECRET` environment variable
- Runs incremental sync (only new/updated grants)
- Max duration: 5 minutes
- Logs all results to database

## How to Use

### Access Admin Dashboard

1. Navigate to your app in browser
2. Click **Connectors** in the sidebar
3. View connector health and metrics
4. Click **Sync** to trigger manual update
5. Click **Full Refresh** for complete re-sync

### Set Up Scheduled Syncs

#### 1. Generate Cron Secret

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

#### 2. Add to Environment Variables

**Local Development** (`.env.local`):
```bash
CRON_SECRET=your-generated-secret-here
```

**Vercel Production**:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add `CRON_SECRET` with your generated value
3. Set for: Production, Preview, Development (as needed)

#### 3. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Phase 2: Production readiness features"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically:
- Detect `vercel.json` cron configuration
- Set up daily scheduled execution
- Begin running syncs at 2:00 AM UTC

#### 4. Monitor Cron Runs

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Navigate to: Your Project â†’ Cron
2. View execution history
3. Check logs for each run
4. Manually trigger test executions

**In Your Database:**
- Check `connector_sync_state` table for latest status
- Check `sync_logs` table for detailed history

### Test Cron Locally

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, trigger cron endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/cron/sync-grants
```

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Background Sync Execution?

The manual sync API (`/api/admin/sync-grants`) returns immediately and runs the sync in background:

```typescript
// Don't wait for sync to complete
pipeline.runAll(connectors, { incremental: !force }).catch((error) => {
  console.error("[admin] Sync error:", error);
});

return NextResponse.json({ message: "Sync started" });
```

**Benefits:**
- Better UX (no long-loading spinner)
- Prevents API timeouts on slow networks
- Users can continue using the app while sync runs
- UI polling shows live progress updates

### Why 30-Second Polling?

```typescript
refetchInterval: 30000, // 30 seconds
```

**Balances:**
- Real-time enough for monitoring (status updates quickly)
- Doesn't overload server with constant requests
- Keeps Vercel/Supabase costs reasonable
- Good compromise for admin-only feature

### Why 2:00 AM UTC for Cron?

**Reasoning:**
- Low traffic time for most US users
- Grants.gov typically publishes daily updates around midnight ET
- Gives time for data to be available
- Completes before business hours in US timezones

### Why Service Role Key for Syncs?

Syncs use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` instead of user authentication:

**Reasons:**
- Bypasses Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Connector needs write access to all organization data
- Runs as system process, not tied to specific user
- Scheduled cron job has no user context

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/connectors` page
- [ ] Verify page loads without errors
- [ ] Check that connector health displays correctly
- [ ] Click "Sync" button and verify:
  - [ ] Button shows loading state
  - [ ] Status updates after ~30 seconds
  - [ ] Sync log appears in Recent Activity
- [ ] Click "Full Refresh" and verify same behavior
- [ ] Wait 30+ seconds and verify auto-refresh works
- [ ] Check database tables:
  - [ ] `connector_sync_state` updated
  - [ ] `sync_logs` has new entries
  - [ ] `opportunities` table has new/updated records

### Cron Testing

- [ ] Add `CRON_SECRET` to `.env.local`
- [ ] Run dev server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Test cron endpoint with curl (see command above)
- [ ] Verify response shows successful sync
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Add `CRON_SECRET` to Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Check Vercel Cron dashboard shows scheduled job
- [ ] Manually trigger test run in Vercel
- [ ] Verify logs show successful execution

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Connector Health

**Via UI:**
1. Go to `/admin/connectors`
2. Look at health badges:
   - Green "healthy" = Last sync <48 hours ago, no errors
   - Yellow "warning" = Last sync >48 hours ago OR never synced
   - Red "error" = Last sync failed with errors

**Via Database:**
```sql
SELECT source, status, health, last_sync_completed_at, errors
FROM connector_sync_state
ORDER BY last_sync_completed_at DESC;
```

### View Sync Logs

**Via UI:**
- Scroll to "Recent Sync Activity" section
- Shows last 10 syncs across all connectors

**Via Database:**
```sql
SELECT source, started_at, status, records_created, records_updated, errors
FROM sync_logs
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Common Issues

**Problem:** Connector shows "warning" status
**Solution:** Check `hours_since_last_sync`. If >48 hours, manually trigger sync or check cron job.

**Problem:** Cron job not running
**Solution:**
1. Verify `CRON_SECRET` is set in Vercel environment variables
2. Check Vercel Cron dashboard for errors
3. Ensure `vercel.json` is committed and deployed

**Problem:** Sync fails with errors
**Solution:**
1. Check sync_logs table for error details
2. View connector_sync_state.errors field
3. Test connector manually with CLI: `npm run sync:grants`

**Problem:** No opportunities being created
**Solution:**
1. Check if running incremental mode (may have no new data)
2. Try full refresh: `npm run sync:grants -- --full`
3. Check Grants.gov API availability
4. Verify SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is correct

## Next Steps (Optional Phase 3)

Phase 2 is complete! Future enhancements could include:

### Error Notifications
- Email alerts when connector fails
- Slack webhook integration
- SMS alerts for critical errors

### Additional Connectors
- Foundation Directory (foundations.org)
- Instrumentl grants database
- State/local government grants
- Private foundation APIs

### Advanced Monitoring
- Connector performance metrics
- Data quality checks
- Duplicate detection alerts
- Sync duration tracking

### Admin Role Protection
- Currently any authenticated user can access `/admin/connectors`
- Add role-based access control (RBAC)
- Check user role in middleware
- Restrict admin endpoints to admin users only
