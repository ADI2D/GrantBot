# Document Upload Feature - Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

A complete document upload system using Supabase Storage with the following features:

### Features
- **File Upload**: Drag & drop or click to upload files
- **File Types Supported**: PDF, Word, Excel, Images, CSV, Plain text
- **Max File Size**: 50MB per file
- **Security**: Private bucket with org-level access control
- **File Management**: Upload, download, delete with activity logging
- **Metadata Tracking**: File name, size, type, upload date, uploader
- **UI**: Beautiful file list with icons, file sizes, and status indicators

### Files Created

1. **Storage Setup Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20241031_storage_setup.sql`
   - Creates `org-documents` storage bucket
   - Sets up RLS policies for org-level access
   - File structure: `org-documents/{org_id}/{filename}`

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - `src/app/api/documents/upload/route.ts` - Upload files
   - `src/app/api/documents/delete/route.ts` - Delete files
   - `src/app/api/documents/download/route.ts` - Generate signed download URLs

3. **UI Component**: `src/components/documents/file-upload.tsx`
   - Reusable upload component with drag & drop
   - File list with download/delete actions
   - Progress indicators and error handling

4. **Type Updates**: `src/types/api.ts`
   - Extended `DocumentMeta` type with file metadata

5. **Integration**: Updated `src/app/(dashboard)/onboarding/page.tsx`
   - Replaced manual document tracking with file upload component

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Storage Migration

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# Open Supabase Dashboard
https://app.supabase.com/project/wwwrchacbyepnvbqhgnb

# Go to: SQL Editor ‚Üí New query
# Copy and paste: supabase/migrations/20241031_storage_setup.sql
# Click: Run
```

This creates:
- `org-documents` storage bucket (private, 50MB limit)
- RLS policies for org-level access control
- Helper function for file URL generation

### Step 2: Verify Storage Bucket

1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase Dashboard
2. You should see `org-documents` bucket
3. Click on it - it should be empty initially
4. Check **Policies** tab - should have 4 policies (insert, select, update, delete)

### Step 3: Test the Feature

```bash
# Start your dev server
npm run dev

# Visit onboarding page
http://localhost:3000/onboarding

# Try uploading a file:
1. Enter a title (e.g., "IRS 990 FY23")
2. Click "Choose file"
3. Select a PDF/Word/Excel file
4. Click "Upload"
```

## üìã How It Works

### Upload Flow

1. **User selects file** ‚Üí Component validates size and type
2. **Click "Upload"** ‚Üí `POST /api/documents/upload`
3. **API validates** ‚Üí Checks auth, org membership, file type
4. **Upload to Storage** ‚Üí `supabase.storage.upload()` to `org-documents/{orgId}/{timestamp}_{filename}`
5. **Update metadata** ‚Üí Adds entry to `organizations.document_metadata` JSONB
6. **Log activity** ‚Üí Inserts to `activity_logs` table
7. **UI updates** ‚Üí Shows file in list with download/delete options

### Download Flow

1. **User clicks download** ‚Üí `GET /api/documents/download?filePath=...`
2. **API validates** ‚Üí Checks auth, org membership, file ownership
3. **Generate signed URL** ‚Üí `supabase.storage.createSignedUrl()` (expires in 1 hour)
4. **Open in new tab** ‚Üí Browser downloads/previews file

### Delete Flow

1. **User clicks delete** ‚Üí `POST /api/documents/delete`
2. **API validates** ‚Üí Checks auth and org membership
3. **Delete from storage** ‚Üí `supabase.storage.remove()`
4. **Remove metadata** ‚Üí Filters out from `document_metadata` JSONB
5. **Log activity** ‚Üí Records deletion
6. **UI updates** ‚Üí File removed from list

## üîí Security

### Access Control
- ‚úÖ Private bucket - requires authentication
- ‚úÖ Org-level isolation - users can only access their org's files
- ‚úÖ RLS policies on storage.objects table
- ‚úÖ Path validation in API (prevents path traversal)
- ‚úÖ File type validation (whitelist only)
- ‚úÖ File size limits (50MB max)

### Storage Policies

```sql
-- Users can only upload to their org folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload files to their org folder"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'org-documents' AND
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT user_id FROM public.org_members
      WHERE organization_id::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
    )
  );

-- Similar policies for SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
```

### API Security
- Auth required on all endpoints
- Org membership verified before any operation
- File paths validated to prevent access to other orgs
- Activity logging for audit trail

## üé® UI Features

### File Upload Component

```tsx
<FileUpload
  orgId="org-uuid"
  documents={documentArray}
  onUploadSuccess={() => {
    // Refresh data
    queryClient.invalidateQueries(["organization"]);
  }}
/>
```

### Features
- **File Icons**: Automatic icons based on MIME type (üìÑ PDF, üìù Word, üìä Excel, üñºÔ∏è Images)
- **File Size Display**: Human-readable format (KB, MB)
- **Upload Date**: Shows when file was uploaded
- **Status Indicators**: Ready, Missing, or custom status
- **Progress Messages**: Upload in progress, success, error states
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

## üìä Data Structure

### DocumentMeta Type
```typescript
{
  title: string;              // User-provided title
  status?: string;            // Ready, Missing, etc.
  fileName?: string;          // Original filename
  filePath?: string;          // Storage path: {orgId}/{timestamp}_{name}
  fileSize?: number;          // Size in bytes
  mimeType?: string;          // MIME type
  uploadedAt?: string;        // ISO timestamp
  uploadedBy?: string;        // User email
  url?: string;               // Storage reference path
}
```

### Storage in Database
```jsonb
// organizations.document_metadata column
[
  {
    "title": "IRS 990 FY23",
    "status": "Ready",
    "fileName": "990-form.pdf",
    "filePath": "8d8d0b4b-8fdc-4d27-92d8-0f4d31e6a001/1730400000000_990-form.pdf",
    "fileSize": 2458624,
    "mimeType": "application/pdf",
    "uploadedAt": "2024-10-31T10:00:00.000Z",
    "uploadedBy": "admin@test.com",
    "url": "org-documents/8d8d0b4b-8fdc-4d27-92d8-0f4d31e6a001/1730400000000_990-form.pdf"
  }
]
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload a PDF file
- [ ] Upload a Word document
- [ ] Upload an Excel spreadsheet
- [ ] Upload an image (JPG/PNG)
- [ ] Try uploading file > 50MB (should fail)
- [ ] Try uploading unsupported type (should fail)
- [ ] Download a file
- [ ] Delete a file
- [ ] Check that other org users can't access files
- [ ] Check activity logs show upload/download/delete

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Bucket not found" error
- Run the storage migration SQL in Supabase Dashboard
- Verify bucket exists in Storage section

### "Upload failed: 403"
- Check that storage policies are created
- Verify user is a member of the organization
- Check browser console for detailed error

### "File not downloading"
- Verify file exists in storage bucket
- Check that download API is generating signed URL
- Ensure signed URL hasn't expired (1 hour limit)

### Files not showing in UI
- Check that `document_metadata` JSONB is updating
- Verify React Query cache is invalidating
- Check browser console for API errors

## üìù Next Steps

### Enhancements You Could Add
1. **Drag & Drop**: HTML5 drag and drop API
2. **Multiple Files**: Upload multiple files at once
3. **Progress Bar**: Show upload progress percentage
4. **File Preview**: PDF viewer, image preview in modal
5. **Virus Scanning**: Integrate antivirus API
6. **OCR**: Extract text from PDFs/images
7. **Versioning**: Keep file history
8. **Folders**: Organize files in subfolders
9. **Sharing**: Generate public links with expiry
10. **Compression**: Auto-compress images before upload

### Integration Ideas
- Link documents to specific proposals
- Attach documents to compliance checklist items
- Include documents in proposal exports
- Auto-populate proposal sections from uploaded documents (OCR + AI)
