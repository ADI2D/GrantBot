# GrantBot Workspace

AI-assisted grant writing workspace that turns the PRD + 90-day roadmap into a runnable Next.js prototype. It showcases onboarding, opportunity curation, proposal drafting, compliance checklists, and analytics flows for <$1M-budget nonprofits.

## Stack & Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind v4)
- **Styling**: Utility-first theme tokens + custom UI primitives (Button, Card, Badge, etc.)
- **State/Data**: React Query client provider ready for Supabase/LLM data sources
- **Integrations (planned)**: Supabase (auth, data, storage), OpenAI (drafting), Stripe (billing)
 - **Integrations**: Supabase (auth, data, storage), Stripe webhook scaffolding ready for billing events
- **Structure**: `/(dashboard)` route group with feature pages that map to PRD requirements

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000` for the marketing overview and `/dashboard` for the authenticated workspace shell.

### Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in keys once Supabase/OpenAI projects are ready.
```
SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_ORG_ID=8d8d0b4b-8fdc-4d27-92d8-0f4d31e6a001
OPENAI_API_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
```

### Supabase Schema & Seed
All tables, indexes, and row-level policies live under `supabase/migrations`. They cover the entire workspace plus the super-admin panel (admin users, audit logs, billing invoices, AI cost events, support tickets, feature flags, pricing plans, etc.).

1. **Install & authenticate CLI** (one-time):
   ```bash
   brew install supabase/tap/supabase   # or npm install -g supabase
   supabase login                       # paste an access token from app.supabase.com
   supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
   ```
2. **Apply schema:**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```
   This replays every migration file in order so the admin panel tables/policies are provisioned together with the core workspace schema.
3. **Load demo content (optional):**
   ```bash
   supabase db seed --file supabase/seed/001_demo_data.sql
   ```
   The seed resets key tables and inserts a configured organization, proposals, billing invoices, AI cost telemetry, admin users, audit logs, support tickets, feature flags, and notes‚Äîeverything the `/admin` experience expects out of the box. Replace the placeholder UUIDs with real `auth.users` IDs once you have Supabase auth wired up.

Set `SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env.local`. The service role key is required for server actions and API routes that write to RLS-protected admin tables (notes, tickets, billing overrides, etc.), while the browser uses the anon key.

### Billing Setup
- Create a Stripe test account and generate a customer record for your organization.
- Copy the **Publishable** and **Secret** keys into `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`.
- Create recurring products/prices in Stripe and record the price IDs in the `pricing_plans` table (via admin pricing settings or Supabase console).
- Add the Stripe customer ID to `organizations.stripe_customer_id` for the org you're testing. Once linked, the ‚ÄúManage billing‚Äù button opens Stripe Billing and the usage cards display invoice information.
- Webhook events (`invoice.*`, `customer.subscription.updated`, etc.) populate the `billing_payments` table. Run `supabase/migrations/20241026_billing_payments.sql` (or `supabase db push`) and set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` so the webhook endpoint can verify signatures.
- To seed Stripe test data locally:
  1. Start webhook forwarding in another terminal:
     ```bash
     stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
     ```
  2. Run the helper script to create a customer, subscription, and paid invoice (defaults to the starter plan):
     ```bash
     npm run seed:stripe -- <organization-id> [plan-id]
     # example
     npm run seed:stripe -- c9634d01-978e-40e6-b257-a6711db5b0da growth
     ```
  3. The script attaches `pm_card_visa`, pays the invoice, and polls Supabase until the webhook writes to `billing_payments`. If it times out, confirm the `stripe listen` process is running.
- Create seed users (owner + member) for a workspace:
  ```bash
  npm run seed:users -- <organization-id> <admin-email> <subscriber-email> [admin-password] [subscriber-password]
  # example
  npm run seed:users -- c9634d01-978e-40e6-b257-a6711db5b0da admin@example.com user@example.com
  ```
  The script creates the auth users (if they do not already exist), marks emails as confirmed, and inserts memberships with `owner` / `member` roles. Temporary passwords are printed to the console when not supplied‚Äîask users to reset after first login.

### Troubleshooting
- **Webhook signature errors:** ensure `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local` matches the secret shown when you run `stripe listen` (or from the Stripe dashboard if using a hosted endpoint). Restart `npm run dev` after updating the env file.
- **Invoice records missing:** confirm the listener is running and that the org has `stripe_customer_id` populated. Use the Supabase dashboard (SQL editor) to query `select * from billing_payments order by created_at desc;` and verify the webhook inserted a row.
- **Migration conflicts:** if `supabase db push` reports existing policies/tables, mark the migration as applied (`supabase migration repair --status applied --version 20241024_initial`) or run the SQL manually via the dashboard.
- **Password reset links:** `npm run seed:users` preps accounts, and users can request a reset from the login form. Supabase emails redirect to `/reset-password`, where they can choose a new password. Ensure `resetPasswordForEmail` redirect URLs in Supabase match your deployed domain.

## Roadmap Alignment
- ‚úÖ MVP skeleton with navigation, Supabase-backed APIs, and UI primitives
- üîú Add auth guards + multi-org switching
- üîú Connect AI orchestration + compliance logic per PRD Section 5
- üîú Implement billing quotas & analytics instrumentation described in the 90-day plan

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` ‚Äì local development with Webpack bundler
- `npm run build` ‚Äì production build
- `npm start` ‚Äì run compiled build
- `npm run lint` ‚Äì lint source files

## Next Steps
1. Fix the dashboard/login loop by aligning org resolution with memberships and removing the service-client auto-provision.
2. Persist org selection and gate onboarding/dashboard routes once the intake flow is complete.
3. Ship write mutations for onboarding, opportunity, proposal, and checklist updates (Supabase + UI forms).
4. Implement the AI drafting/compliance flows (OpenAI integration, content persistence, UX polish).
5. Wire analytics tracking (PostHog/Segment or preferred stack) per the 90-day roadmap.
6. Harden Stripe integration for production (real price IDs/keys, webhook verification in deployed envs, invoice download links).
7. Add automated test coverage (unit + E2E) and document deployment/runbooks.
