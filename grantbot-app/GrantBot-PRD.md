## 1. Executive Summary

### Product Vision
- Deliver full-service grant proposal generation that combines AI drafting with human review so nonprofits ($250K–$1M budgets) submit competitive, fundable applications in days instead of weeks.
- Target Users & Use Case: Executive Directors and Development/Fundraising Managers who need 1–5 compliant grant submissions per month but lack staff capacity.
- Differentiator & Value: AI-guided workflow trained on funded proposals, embedded compliance guardrails, plus on-demand expert editing—faster and cheaper than consultants, higher quality than DIY templates.
- Success Definition: 500 paying organizations averaging three proposals per quarter, 40%+ award rate, $5M ARR within 24 months, gross margin 65%, churn <5%.

### Strategic Alignment
- Business Objectives Supported: Accelerate ARR growth to $5M, land 100 logos in 12 months, build wedge into broader fundraising SaaS.
- User Problems Solved: Expertise gap, budget constraints, slow manual drafting, low historical win rates (~15%).
- Market Opportunity & Timing: $500B+ annual grant pool; 88K underserved small nonprofits; grant-management software market growing from $3.07B (2025) to $7.44B (2034).
- Competitive Advantage: Subscription pricing + AI + expert network; speed + affordability + continuously learning success engine.

### Resource Requirements
- Development Effort: 6-month MVP, 12-month GA; ~12 FTE (PM, 3 FE, 3 BE/ML, 2 designers, 2 grant strategists, 1 RevOps/ops lead).
- Timeline & Milestones: Month 0–1 discovery, Month 2 manual alpha, Month 4 automation beta, Month 6 paid MVP, Month 9 research module, Month 12 donor CRM beta.
- Team Skills Needed: AI/ML orchestration, grant domain expertise, UX for complex workflows, GTM for nonprofit space.
- Budget & Allocation: $50K initial MVP budget; ~$1.2M year-one run (40% engineering, 25% GTM, 20% domain experts, 15% ops/support).

## 2. Problem Statement & Opportunity

### Problem Definition
- Pain Points: Small nonprofits lack affordable expert grant writers; consultants charge $500–$2,500 per proposal or 5–8% of awards; DIY attempts fail compliance checks and funder fit; proposal cycles take 4–6 weeks and yield 15% win rates.
- Quantified Impact: 60% of nonprofits cite grant-writing capacity as a barrier; low win rates waste staff hours and jeopardize programs.
- Evidence: Active complaints in Facebook groups/Reddit; webinar Q&A reveals constant rejection stories; early pilots require manual support to meet demand.
- Research Backing: Market reports (Instrumentl, GrantWritingMadeEasy) highlight capacity gaps and rising grant competition; beta interviews confirm willingness to pay for faster, expert-guided automation.

### Opportunity Analysis
- Market Size: $500B+ grant pool; grant software CAGR 7.38%; immediate Serviceable Available Market ≈ 20K US nonprofits ($180M revenue potential at $750/mo ACV).
- User Segment: Organizations with $250K–$1M budgets, 3–12 grant submissions/year, lean teams (<5 staff).
- Revenue Impact: Subscription tiers ($249–$999/mo), upsell consulting retainers ($1K–$3K/mo), success fees (2–10% awards) → $5M+ ARR potential.
- Competitive Gap: Legacy SaaS focuses on discovery/submission tracking; freelancers don’t scale; GrantBot merges AI + expert network for end-to-end drafting.

### Success Criteria
- Primary Metrics: 40% proposal win rate, $5M ARR within 24 months, 500 paying customers, NPS 50+, churn <5%.
- Secondary Metrics: Onboarding completion 90%, proposal revision count <3, human editor SLA <24h, 80% of users submit ≥1 proposal/quarter.
- Behavioral Changes: Users rely on GrantBot as primary drafting workflow, shift from consultant spend to subscription, faster submission cadence.
- Business Outcomes: Predictable recurring revenue, data moat via funded proposal corpus, foundation for adjacent fundraising tools.

## 3. User Requirements & Stories

### Primary User Personas
| Persona | Description | Goals & Motivations | Current Pain Points | Success Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Executive Director Erin | Leads <$1M nonprofit, wears multiple hats | Predictable funding, board confidence, minimal overhead | Can’t afford consultants, overwhelmed by proposals, low win rate | Submit proposals in <1 week, win >2 grants/yr, clear reporting |
| Development Manager Devin | Owns fundraising strategy, limited staff | Higher throughput, compliance confidence, strategic targeting | Manual copy/paste, research overload, unclear feedback loops | 3+ high-quality submissions/quarter, compliance checklist, collaboration tools |
| Volunteer Grant Writer Val | Part-time contributor, not expert | Clear prompts, reusable templates, guidance | Lacks data, no version control, fear of mistakes | Simple onboarding, AI suggestions, approval workflow |

### User Journey Mapping
- **Current State**: Discover grant → scramble for templates → manual data gathering → rewrite old narrative → chase approvals via email → submit with guesswork → wait months without insights.
- **Future State**: Complete org profile & upload docs → GrantBot surfaces prioritized opportunities → select RFP → AI drafts sections with compliance checklist → collaborate with teammates/expert editor → export + track submission → log outcome & insights feed future drafts.
- **Key Touchpoints**: Onboarding wizard, grant catalog, drafting workspace, collaboration panel, analytics dashboard, notification center.
- **Pain & Opportunity Areas**: Data intake friction, compliance verification, reviewer feedback loops, status transparency—addressed via guided wizard, automated checklists, comment threads, outcome analytics.

### Core User Stories
1. **Epic: Org Onboarding**  
   - As an ED, I want a guided intake to capture mission, budgets, and impact so the system can personalize future proposals.  
   - Acceptance: Required fields validated, document uploads stored securely, progress autosaved, completion under 20 minutes.
2. **Epic: Grant Matching**  
   - As a Development Manager, I want prioritized grant recommendations aligned to our programs so I spend time on viable opportunities.  
   - Acceptance: Filter by geography/amount/cause, match score display, deadline reminders, one-click move to drafting.
3. **Epic: Proposal Generation**  
   - As a grant writer, I want AI-generated narratives tailored to a specific RFP so I can submit within 48 hours.  
   - Acceptance: Uses org data + funder requirements, outputs all sections (need, program, budget, outcomes), highlights missing info, compliance checklist reaches 100% before export.
4. **Epic: Collaboration & Review**  
   - As a team, we want comments, versioning, and optional expert editors so we maintain quality and approvals.  
   - Acceptance: Role-based permissions, track changes, request expert review with SLA, full audit log.
5. **Epic: Outcome Analytics**  
   - As leadership, I need dashboards showing submission counts, win/loss, and insights so I can report to the board and iterate strategy.  
   - Acceptance: Log submissions, update status, record award amounts, recommendations for next steps.

Priority & Dependencies: Onboarding → Matching → Drafting → Collaboration → Analytics. AI drafting depends on profile completeness and grant metadata quality.

## 10. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- AI hallucinations affecting compliance.  
- Integration complexity with grant data sources and CRMs.  
- Performance bottlenecks during simultaneous draft generations.

**Mitigation**: RAG with sourcing, confidence scoring, fallbacks to human review; phased integrations; autoscaling + queuing for AI jobs.

### Business Risks
- Market competition from established platforms or consultants lowering prices.  
- Budget tightening among target nonprofits leading to slower adoption.  
- Skepticism toward AI reliability in compliance-heavy workflows.

**Mitigation**: Highlight speed + affordability + success metrics, flexible contracts, educational content, transparent AI explainability.

### Regulatory & Legal Risks
- Data privacy (GDPR/CCPA) violations, grant compliance misinterpretation.  
- Changes in funding regulations requiring platform updates.

**Mitigation**: Legal counsel review, configurable compliance templates, rapid update pipeline.

### Monitoring & Contingency
- Probability/impact matrix reviewed monthly.  
- Early warning: spike in error rates, drop in win rate, negative CSAT.  
- Response: rollback AI model, enable manual support, communicate with customers transparently.
